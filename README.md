## iPhone Sales Analysis Project

### Description

This project analyzes a dataset of Apple iPhones available on Flipkart to explore various aspects of their pricing, ratings, discounts, and other attributes. The dataset includes information on product names, URLs, brands, prices, MRP, discount percentages, number of ratings, number of reviews, UPC, rating, and RAM. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the relationships between these attributes and to visualize trends within the data.

### Objectives

- **Understand Pricing and Discounts:** Examine the relationship between iPhone prices and discount percentages to identify trends and pricing strategies.
- **Analyze Ratings and Reviews:** Determine which iPhone models are most highly rated and investigate how the number of ratings correlates with factors such as price and discount percentage.
- **Visualize Data Relationships:** Create visualizations to illustrate key relationships in the dataset, including the impact of price on discount percentages and the distribution of ratings and reviews among different models.

### Key Findings

1. **Pricing and Discounts:** Higher-priced iPhones generally have lower discount percentages, while lower-priced models often offer higher discounts. The maximum discount observed is 29%.
2. **Top-Rated Products:** The iPhone 8 Plus (Gold, 64 GB) is the most highly rated model in the dataset, indicating strong consumer satisfaction.
3. **Price vs. Number of Ratings:** There is a negative linear relationship between iPhone prices and the number of ratings, suggesting that more affordable models receive more ratings and likely experience higher sales volumes.
4. **Discount Percentage vs. Price:** Higher discounts are associated with lower prices, supporting the strategy of offering substantial discounts on budget-friendly models to enhance their appeal.
